This FSA workshop had some small bugs but actually is extremely important in understanding express and Sequelize.
I'd definitely recommend spending a fair amount of time on it to fully understand.

Follow it step by step and you shouldn't have any issues.  Be sure to test your code after everything you add :)

If you end up getting an error like (SequelizeDatabaseError: column "authorId" does not exist) -> .sync({force: true}) once, 
save it then you can delete the force true.  Or you can probably just delete your tables and rerun your server.
